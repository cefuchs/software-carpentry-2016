And Bernie for president? Did you hear the debate, quite a riot, that debate. 
Bernie shook his head at Hillary a lot. Hillary did the same.

All my political news is from 5-minute NPR hourly news reports, so I'm missing out on all 
the head-shaking action...

I'm being argumentative and making a conflicting edit ahhhh! Worst teammate ever!
